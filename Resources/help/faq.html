<div class="section">
<h1>What's the difference between Chicken and Chicken of the VNC?</h1>
<p>Chicken is an improved version of Chicken of the VNC. Chicken of the VNC has
essentially been abandoned by its developers. Chicken is an independent project,
which builds on CotVNC to add new features and bug fixes, while remaining
streamlined and easy to use.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Can I use my saved servers and passwords from Chicken of the VNC in
Chicken?</h1>

<p>If you've previously used Chicken of the VNC, any preferences or saved
servers will be imported by Chicken the first time it is run. However, saved
passwords are not copied.</p>

<p>If you wish to transfer your saved passwords, you can do
this manually. First open <strong>Keychain Access</strong> in the Utilities
folder. For each keychain item called <strong>cotvnc</strong>, double click and
change the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Where</strong> fields to
<strong>Chicken</strong>, and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.
Similarly, change <strong>cotvnc-zeroconf</strong> to
<strong>Chicken-zeroconf</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Screen Sharing is enabled, so why does Chicken say I can't connect?</h1>
<p>In the Screen Sharing settings on the remote computer, you need to check the
box which says <strong>VNC viewers may control screen</strong>.</p>

<p>Apple's Screen Sharing is based on VNC, but it is not completely compatible.
One difference is that Screen Sharing, by default, requires both a username and
password to log in, where as standard VNC only requires a password. Chicken only
supports the standard VNC log in, which is why you need to tell Screen Sharing
to enable VNC authentication.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>What do the errors "Unknown rectangle encoding," "Unknown message type,"
"Protocol error," etc. mean?</h1>

<p>These indicate that Chicken got confused by the data that the server was
sending to it. This could be caused by a bug in the VNC server software.
However, just between you and me, it's more likely that there's a bug in
Chicken. Many times this error message also tells you what the previous encoding
is, and that encoding may be the root cause. You can a disable a given encoding
in <strong>Conection Profiles</strong> and the <strong>Encodings</strong> tab.
Be sure to re-enable encodings which
don't cause problems as these may give you a better connection.</p>

<p>Also, please
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=364722&atid=1521165">report a bug</a>,
which should include the encoding that seems to be responsible, the VNC server
software, when the error occurs (immediately after connecting, only after moving
the mouse, etc.), and anything else about how the error occurs.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>I Get Strange Characters When I Type</h1>
	
<p>Chicken tries hard to work with different keyboard layouts. However, not
all servers will know how to handle all characters which might be on your
keyboard. There are a couple of things to try for better keyboard
compatibility.</p>

<p>First, VNC will work best if the server and client are both configured to use
the same keyboard layout. Second, if you're connecting to a virtual machine, it
generally works better to run a VNC server within the virtualized OS, rather
than using a VNC server built into the virtualization software. VNC is designed
to work at the OS level rather than the level of emulated hardware.</p>

<p>Third, you can change the way that Chicken interprets the Option key.  By
default, Chicken will treat the Option key as Meta or Option on the remote
computer. If you instead want to use the option key to enter special characters
by OS X shortcuts, go to the <strong>Modifiers</strong> tab in
<strong>Connection Profiles</strong> and change the setting for the option key
to <strong>none (local keymap)</strong>.</p>

<p>If you still have problems with the keyboard, <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=364722&atid=1521165">file a bug report</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>What about dead keys?</h1>

<p>Chicken does not support dead keys. If you type a dead key, it just won't
send anything to the server. Sometimes, you can get around this by typing the
key combinations which trigger the dead key on the remote server. For example,
if the remote server is a Mac with a US keyboard layout, typing Option-e will
add an acute accent to the next letter (assuming that the option key is set to
<strong>Meta (Option)</strong> in <strong>Connection Profiles</strong>).
</p></div>

<div class="section">
    <h1>Why Can't I Control Click?</h1>

    <p>By default, Chicken interprets control-clicks as right clicks. If you
    need to send a control-click, you can change the emulation for right mouse
    button to something other than control-click, as described
    <a href="profiles.html#emulation">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
	<h1>How 'Bout Command-Option-Escape, Control-Alt-Delete and Other Strange Combos?</h1>
	
	<p>You can force-quit applications on a remote Macintosh by sending the CMD-OPT-ESC keystroke from the <strong>Connection</strong> menu's <strong>Special Keys</strong> submenu.</p>

	<p>Likewise, Windows machines commonly use the CTRL-ALT-DEL keystroke.  You can send this keystroke by choosing <strong>Send Ctrl-Alt-Del</strong> from the <strong>Connection</strong> menu's <strong>Special Keys</strong> submenu.  If you'd prefer to type the keystroke, you can do this by simply hitting the keys that map to it.  In the default configuration, this is CTRL-CMD-DEL (the CMD key is also referred to as the Apple key).</p>
	
	<p>On machines that don't have a DEL key (such as laptops), you can use the function key and the ordinary delete key.  In the default configuration, you would use CTRL-CMD-FN-DELETE.</p>

	<p>Similarly, to send Alt-F4 on a laptop (where F4 is mapped to sound volume), you can use CMD-FN-F4.</p>

	<p>You can see additional uses for the Function key on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Hardware/Developer_Notes/Macintosh_CPUs-G4/17inchPowerBookG4/3Input-Output/chapter_4_section_11.html" target="_blank">Apple's Laptop Technical Pages</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong>Connection</strong> menu's <strong>Special Keys</strong> submenu has several other commonly used keystrokes that are not found on Macintosh keyboards.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1>What's the difference between the display number and the port number?</h1>
<p>The port is just the display number plus 5900.
If you enter a number less than 50, Chicken assumes it's a display number and
adds 5900 to get the port. If you enter a number greater than or equal than 50,
then Chicken assumes it's a port and uses that.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Okay, so how do I connect on a port less than 50?</h1>

<p>Enter <em>host</em>:<em>port</em> in the host name instead of just
<em>host</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>How can I import my server list from somewhere else?</h1>

<p>Importing servers is not directly supported. However, as of Chicken 2.2b1,
the server list is stored in a standard property list format which you can edit
if you're comfortable with the command line and XML.</p>

<p> First, make a backup copy of Chicken's preference file
<strong>~/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.chicken.plist</strong>.
Then run <strong>plutil -convert xml1
~/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.chicken.plist</strong>. The file is now is
now an XML representation of all of Chicken's preferences, including the
servers, which are stored under the <strong>SavedServers2</strong> key. By
looking at examples, it should be clear in what format to add new servers to the
list. When you're done editing, type run <strong>plutil -convert binary1
~/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.chicken.plist</strong> to convert back to
binary format.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h1>What is the coolest feature of Chicken?</h1>

<p>Chicken can tint the remote display for visual distinguishability. When the
remote server is running a different OS, it is easy to distinguish local windows
from remote windows because they look different. However, when the remote OS is
also a Mac, then there is no immediate visual clue as to whether a window is
remote or local. In the <strong>Colors</strong> tab of the <strong>Connection
Profiles</strong>, you can choose to tint the remote display to provide such
this visual hint.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h1>How can I help?</h1>
<p>The source code is available
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=364722">on
SourceForge</a>. Patches for bug fixes or feature additions can be submitted
through the SourceForge tracker.</p>

<p>What Chicken really needs is more complete translations. If you speak French,
Italian, or Japanese, you'll notice that Chicken speaks a mixture of your
language and English. These translations were inherited from CotVNC, but newer
features are only in English. If you want to help translate, you can start by
adding missing translations to the
<a href="../French.lproj/Localizable.strings">French</a>,
<a href="../Italian.lproj/Localizable.strings">Italian</a>, or
<a href="../Japanese.lproj/Localizable.strings">Japanese</a> string lists or by
adding starting with the
<a href="../English.lproj/Localizable.strings">English-language</a> strings to
provide a translation to a whole new language.</p>
