<div class="section">
<p>Chicken is originally based on a program called VNCViewer, written by Helmut
Maierhofer for OpenStep on Intel. Jason Harris ported VNCViewer to the Cocoa API
on Mac OS X with the name Chicken of the VNC to avoid confusion with several VNC
programs on Mac OS X. After several years of inactivity, Chicken was started,
based on the Chicken of the VNC code, with several improvements.</p>
